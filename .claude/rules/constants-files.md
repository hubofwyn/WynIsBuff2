# Constants Files Rules

- **Assets.js** is AUTO-GENERATED by `bun run generate-assets`. NEVER edit manually.
- **EventNames.js** is manually maintained. Events follow `namespace:action` format (e.g., `player:jump`, `level:complete`).
- **SceneKeys.js** is manually maintained. Every scene must have a key here.

When adding new events: add to `EventNames.js` with the `NAMESPACE_ACTION` constant name pattern.
When adding new scenes: add to `SceneKeys.js` with the `SCENE_NAME` constant name pattern.
When adding new assets: edit `/assets/manifest.json` then run `bun run generate-assets`.
