## Project Summary

**WynIsBuff2** is a 2D game built with the following core technologies:

- **Phaser 3.90.x**: HTML5 game framework providing the core game engine functionality
- **Rapier 0.17.x**: 2D physics engine for realistic physics simulations
- **Vite 7.x**: Modern build tool for fast development and optimized production builds

The game features a character that can move and perform triple jumps across platforms, with physics-based interactions powered by the Rapier physics engine.

## Getting Started

For complete development setup instructions, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started).

**Quick Start**:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for:

- Detailed development workflow
- Architecture patterns and conventions
- Asset management and testing guidelines
- Migration guide for existing code
