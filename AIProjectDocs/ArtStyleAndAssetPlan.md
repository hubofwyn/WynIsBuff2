## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive art style and asset requirements for the WynIsBuff2 game. It serves as the definitive guide for creating and implementing all visual and audio elements that align with the game's "outrageous, bombastic, wild" theme centered around buffness.

## Art Style Overview

### Core Visual Identity: "Hyper-Buff Pixel Explosion"

The art style for WynIsBuff2 should embrace an **over-the-top, exaggerated "hyper-buff" aesthetic** that combines clean pixel art with absurdly proportioned characters and bombastic visual effects. The style should be immediately recognizable, visually striking, and communicate the game's humor and energy at first glance.

### Key Visual Elements

1. **Exaggerated Proportions**: Characters with ridiculously oversized muscles, tiny legs, and comically large upper bodies
2. **High-Contrast Color Palette**: Bold, vibrant colors with strong outlines that "pop" against backgrounds
3. **Dynamic Animations**: Extreme squash and stretch principles that emphasize the physics-based gameplay
4. **Visual Humor**: Visual gags embedded in animations, environments, and character designs
5. **Particle Explosions**: Over-the-top particle effects for jumps, landings, and power-ups

### Color Palette

Create a distinctive, high-energy color palette featuring:
- **Primary Colors**: Bold, saturated primary colors (especially reds and blues) for the main character
- **Complementary Accents**: Bright yellows and purples for power-ups and special effects
- **Contrast**: Strong light/dark contrasts to emphasize the "buff" silhouettes
- **Gym-Inspired Tones**: Colors reminiscent of gym equipment (chrome silvers, energetic reds, protein-shake blues)

## Character Assets

### Main Character: "Wyn the Buff"
