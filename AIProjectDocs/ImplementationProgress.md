## Overview

This document tracks the progress of the WynIsBuff2 MVP implementation according to the [Revised MVP Implementation Plan](./RevisedMVPImplementationPlan.md). It provides a clear overview of what has been completed, what is currently in progress, and what remains to be done.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Core Architecture
- ‚úÖ **1.1 Event System Implementation** (Completed)
  - Created `EventSystem.js` module with core functionality
  - Created `EventNames.js` constants file with standardized event names
  - Updated Game scene to initialize and use the Event System
  - Modified PhysicsManager to emit and listen for physics-related events
  - Updated PlayerController to emit jump events and other player state changes
  - Implemented debug mode for event tracing during development

- ‚úÖ **1.2 Basic UI Manager Implementation** (Completed)
  - Created `UIManager.js` module with essential functionality
  - Implemented text creation and management
  - Added button handling with hover effects
  - Implemented UI element positioning and grouping
  - Connected UI Manager to Event System for updates
  - Implemented responsive positioning for different screen sizes
  - Added methods for showing/hiding UI elements based on game state

### Phase 2: Gameplay Enhancements
- ‚úÖ **2.1 Triple Jump Refinement** (Completed)
  - Implemented modular player controller architecture
  - Created specialized controllers for jumping, movement, and collisions
  - Implemented effect managers for particles, camera effects, and color transitions
  - Enhanced visual feedback with color changes, particles, and screen shake
  - Refined jump physics with buffering, variable height, and improved air control
  - Added "coyote time" and landing recovery mechanics
  - Created comprehensive documentation for the new architecture

- ‚úÖ **2.2 Level System Architecture** (Completed)
  - Created modular level system architecture following SOLID principles
  - Implemented specialized classes for different level components:
    - GroundFactory for ground creation and management
    - PlatformFactory for static platforms
    - MovingPlatformController for dynamic platforms
    - CollectibleManager for collectibles
    - LevelCompletionManager for level completion logic
    - LevelTransitionController for level transitions
    - LevelLoader for loading level data
  - Created LevelData.js with configurations for 5 focused levels
  - Implemented facade pattern with LevelManager for simplified interface
  - Created backward compatibility wrapper for existing code
  - Documented the architecture in ModularLevelArchitecture.md and ModularLevelSystemImplementation.md

- ‚úÖ **2.3 Level Implementation** (Completed)
  - Updated Game.js to use the modular level system
  - Enhanced PhysicsManager with collision detection for collectibles
  - Created GameStateManager for game state persistence
  - Updated MainMenu.js with level selection UI
  - Updated GameOver.js with game completion stats
  - Implemented collectible interactions and level completion triggers
  - Added level transitions and progress tracking
  - Created comprehensive documentation in LevelImplementationSummary.md

## Current Status

All planned components for the MVP have been successfully implemented. The game now features:

1. A modular architecture with specialized components for different responsibilities
2. A refined triple jump system with enhanced visual feedback
3. A complete level system with 5 focused levels
4. Collectibles and level completion triggers
5. Level selection and progress tracking
6. Game state persistence using localStorage

The implementation follows the architectural principles outlined in the [Architectural Overview](./ArchitecturalOverview.md), [Modular Architecture](./ModularArchitecture.md), and [Modular Level Architecture](./ModularLevelArchitecture.md) documentation.

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Polish and Finalization
- üîÑ **3.1 Audio and Visual Polish** (Next Priority)
  - Implement basic sound effects
  - Add simple background music
  - Enhance visual elements
  - Create transition effects between levels

## Remaining Work

### Phase 3: Polish and Finalization (continued)
- **3.2 Testing and Optimization**
  - Perform comprehensive testing
  - Optimize performance
  - Ensure consistent frame rate
