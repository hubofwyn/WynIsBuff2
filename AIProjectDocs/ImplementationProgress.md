## Overview

This document tracks the progress of the WynIsBuff2 MVP implementation according to the [Revised MVP Implementation Plan](./RevisedMVPImplementationPlan.md). It provides a clear overview of what has been completed, what is currently in progress, and what remains to be done.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Core Architecture
- ‚úÖ **1.1 Event System Implementation** (Completed)
  - Created `EventSystem.js` module with core functionality
  - Created `EventNames.js` constants file with standardized event names
  - Updated Game scene to initialize and use the Event System
  - Modified PhysicsManager to emit and listen for physics-related events
  - Updated PlayerController to emit jump events and other player state changes
  - Implemented debug mode for event tracing during development

- ‚úÖ **1.2 Basic UI Manager Implementation** (Completed)
  - Created `UIManager.js` module with essential functionality
  - Implemented text creation and management
  - Added button handling with hover effects
  - Implemented UI element positioning and grouping
  - Connected UI Manager to Event System for updates
  - Implemented responsive positioning for different screen sizes
  - Added methods for showing/hiding UI elements based on game state

### Phase 2: Gameplay Enhancements
- ‚úÖ **2.1 Triple Jump Refinement** (Completed)
  - Implemented modular player controller architecture
  - Created specialized controllers for jumping, movement, and collisions
  - Implemented effect managers for particles, camera effects, and color transitions
  - Enhanced visual feedback with color changes, particles, and screen shake
  - Refined jump physics with buffering, variable height, and improved air control
  - Added "coyote time" and landing recovery mechanics
  - Created comprehensive documentation for the new architecture

## Current Status

The core architectural components (Event System and UI Manager) and the Triple Jump Refinement have been successfully implemented. The player controller has been refactored into a modular architecture with specialized controllers and effect managers, providing enhanced visual feedback and refined jump mechanics.

The implementation follows the architectural principles outlined in the [Architectural Overview](./ArchitecturalOverview.md) and meets the requirements specified in the [Event System](./EventSystem.md), [UI Manager](./UIManager.md), and [Modular Player Controller](./ModularPlayerController.md) documentation.

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Gameplay Enhancements (continued)
- üîÑ **2.2 Level Implementation** (Next Priority)
  - Create 3-5 focused levels following the level design guide
  - Implement simple level transition system
  - Add basic collectibles using existing physics system
  - Create level completion triggers and feedback

## Remaining Work

### Phase 2: Gameplay Enhancements (continued)
- **2.2 Level Implementation**
  - Create 3-5 focused levels following the level design guide
  - Implement simple level transition system
  - Add basic collectibles using existing physics system
  - Create level completion triggers and feedback

### Phase 3: Polish and Finalization
- **3.1 Audio and Visual Polish**
  - Implement basic sound effects
  - Add simple background music
  - Enhance visual elements
  - Create transition effects between levels

- **3.2 Testing and Optimization**
  - Perform comprehensive testing
  - Optimize performance
  - Ensure consistent frame rate

## Timeline

| Phase | Status | Original Estimate | Actual Time | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| 1.1 Event System | ‚úÖ Complete | 1-2 days | 2 days | Core functionality implemented |
| 1.2 UI Manager | ‚úÖ Complete | 1-2 days | 1.5 days | All planned features implemented |
| 2.1 Triple Jump Refinement | ‚úÖ Complete | 1-2 days | 2 days | Modular architecture implemented |
| 2.2 Level Implementation | üîÑ Next | 2 days | - | Ready to begin implementation |
| 3.1 Audio and Visual Polish | ‚è≥ Pending | 1-2 days | - | - |
| 3.2 Testing and Optimization | ‚è≥ Pending | 1 day | - | - |

The MVP implementation is progressing according to plan, with the core architectural components and triple jump refinement now complete. The focus will now shift to level implementation to showcase the enhanced jump mechanics.
