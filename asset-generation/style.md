# WynIsBuff2 – Art Direction Style

Target: playful, clean pixel‑inspired hybrid with bold silhouettes and readable gameplay shapes.

- Palette: vibrant accents on muted industrial bases; avoid neon blow‑outs.
- Edges: crisp forms with subtle softening (no heavy blur); sprite outlines optional, 1–2px.
- Lighting: simple two‑tone shading; mild rim light on characters.
- Textures: minimal noise; readable at 2× scale; no heavy dithering.
- Backgrounds: parallax‑friendly layers; depth haze; industrial motifs for Protein Plant.
- Bosses: iconic shapes, clear weak points; motion feels rhythmic for Pulsar; mass/weight for Bulk.
- Output: sprites PNG‑32 with alpha; backdrops WebP; square canvases for thumbs/finals.
