```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ INDEX.md              # Complete navigation
â”œâ”€â”€ architecture/         # System design docs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ development/          # Developer workflow
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ features/            # Feature-specific guides
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/              # Agent system docs
