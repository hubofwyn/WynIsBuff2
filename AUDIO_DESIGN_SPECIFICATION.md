- **Release**: Quick tail (50-100ms)
- **Dynamics**: Medium impact, not overpowering
- **Tone**: Slightly muffled, organic, grounded

**ElevenLabs Prompt**:
```

- Pro: $99/month (~360 minutes of audio)

**Estimated Project Cost**:
- Total SFX needed: ~150-200 individual sounds √ó 0.5 seconds avg = ~1.5 minutes total
- Total Music needed: ~8 tracks √ó 3 minutes avg = ~24 minutes total
- **Total**: ~25-30 minutes of audio
- **Recommended Plan**: Creator ($22/month) should be sufficient for 2-3 generation passes

**Budget Tracking**:
- Implement BudgetGuard pattern from asset generation framework
- Track generation cost per asset category
- Set soft cap at $20/day, $50/month as per ASSET_GENERATION_MIGRATION_PLAN.md

## Priority Implementation

### Phase 1: Critical Path (Bug #4 Fix) ‚≠ê

**Goal**: Fix Bug #4 - Add missing jump sounds

**Audio Needed**:
1. Jump 1 sound (4 variants) - CRITICAL
2. Jump 2 sound (4 variants) - CRITICAL
3. Jump 3 sound (4 variants) - CRITICAL
4. Landing sounds (soft, medium, hard - 3 variants each) - HIGH

**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Cost**: ~$2-3 (12 SFX sounds √ó ~0.3 seconds each)

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Generate jump sounds using ElevenLabs with prompts from Section 1.1
2. Post-process and normalize
3. Add to manifest.json:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "audio",
     "key": "sfxJump1A",
     "path": "audio/sfx/sfx_player_jump1_01.ogg"
   }
   ```
4. Update ParticleManager.js to play sounds alongside particle effects
5. Test in-game and adjust volumes
6. Generate remaining landing sounds

3. Error/feedback sounds

**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Cost**: ~$1-2

---

### Phase 5: Music (Foundation)

**Goal**: Add main menu and first level music

1. Main Menu theme
2. Protein Plant level music
3. Level complete jingle

**Timeline**: 5-7 days
**Cost**: ~$5-8

---

### Phase 6: Music (Complete)

**Goal**: Finish all music tracks

**Audio Needed**:
1. Boss battle music
2. Hub world music
3. Additional level themes
4. Game over music

**Timeline**: 7-10 days
**Cost**: ~$8-12

---

## Total Project Estimates

### Audio Asset Count

- **SFX**: ~150-200 individual sounds
- **Music**: ~8-10 tracks
- **Total**: ~160-210 audio assets

### Total Cost

- **Phase 1** (Critical): $2-3
- **Phases 2-4** (Gameplay): $7-12
- **Phases 5-6** (Music): $13-20
- **Total**: $22-35 (fits within Creator plan at $22/month for 2 months)

### Total Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Bug #4): 1-2 days
- **Complete SFX**: 2-3 weeks
- **Complete Music**: 3-4 weeks
- **Total**: 5-7 weeks for full audio implementation

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Checklist

For each audio asset:

- [ ] Correct duration (not too long or short)
- [ ] Proper format (OGG Vorbis, 44.1 kHz, 16-bit)
- [ ] Normalized to specified loudness (-3 dBFS for SFX, -16 LUFS for music)
- [ ] No clipping or distortion
- [ ] Clean start and end (no pops or clicks)
- [ ] Loops seamlessly (for looping music)
- [ ] Named correctly per convention
- [ ] Added to manifest.json
- [ ] Tested in-game at various volume levels
- [ ] Sounds good on both headphones and speakers
- [ ] Fits the game's aesthetic and mood

### In-Game Audio Mixing

**Volume Hierarchy** (relative levels):
- Music: 100% (adjustable by player)
- SFX: 120% (slightly louder than music for clarity)
- UI sounds: 80% (quieter, less intrusive)

**Ducking** (optional):
- Reduce music volume by 20% during intense gameplay moments
- Reduce music volume by 30% during boss battles for SFX clarity

## Appendix A: Alternative Services

If ElevenLabs is insufficient for certain needs:

### For SFX

**Bark (Suno AI)**:
- **Pros**: Free, local generation, good for voice-like sounds
- **Cons**: Limited quality compared to ElevenLabs
- **Use Case**: Simple SFX, prototyping

**Sonogen (Stability AI)**:
- **Pros**: High quality, good for realistic sounds
- **Cons**: API access limited
- **Use Case**: Realistic environmental sounds

### For Music

**MusicGen (Meta)**:
- **Pros**: Free, local generation, good quality
- **Cons**: Requires local setup, slower generation
- **Use Case**: Background music, ambient tracks

**AIVA**:
- **Pros**: Specifically designed for game music
- **Cons**: Subscription required, less flexibility
- **Use Case**: Orchestral or cinematic music

**Recommendation**: Start with ElevenLabs for consistency, use alternatives only if specific needs arise.

## Appendix B: Prompt Engineering Tips

### For Best ElevenLabs Results

1. **Be Specific About Duration**: Always specify exact seconds
2. **Use Comparative References**: "Like [famous game/song]" helps AI understand
3. **Describe Feeling, Not Just Sound**: "Makes player feel accomplished" guides emotion
4. **Technical Terms**: Use "sub-bass", "transient", "attack", "decay" for precision
5. **Iterate**: Generate multiple versions, refine prompts based on results
6. **Layer Descriptions**: Describe multiple elements ("rumble + impact + sparkle")

### Common Pitfalls

- **Too Vague**: "Jump sound" ‚Üí Too generic
- **Too Complex**: Describing 10 different elements ‚Üí AI gets confused
- **Wrong Context**: Forgetting to mention "for a platform game" ‚Üí Gets wrong style
- **No Duration**: AI chooses random length ‚Üí Inconsistent results
