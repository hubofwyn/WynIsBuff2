# WynIsBuff2 💪🎮💥

## 🔥🔥 THE BUFFEST, THE GAMEST, THE MOST ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS BUFF GAME EVER CREATED! 🔥🔥

Welcome to **WynIsBuff2**, where **Wyn isn't just Buff, Wyn is MEGA-ULTRA-HYPER-BUFF** and the game is so game that it games harder than any game that has ever gamed in the history of gaming since games were invented!

Do you have what it takes to **witness pure, unfiltered, RAW BUFFNESS**? Can you handle the sheer **EXPLOSIVE GAMING POWER** of **WynIsBuff2**? This game will make your **gaming biceps EXPLODE** and your **brain muscles FLEX** to the **ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM BUFFNESS LIMIT**!

## 🏋️‍♂️💪 FEATURES OF EXTREME BUFFNESS
- **TRIPLE JUMP MECHANICS** – Leap with increasing power that gets SO BUFF your screen might crack from the sheer force!
- **PHYSICS-POWERED MOVEMENT** – Rapier physics engine so realistic your computer might start sweating protein shake!
- **MODULAR ARCHITECTURE** – Code so buff it not only flexes on other codebases, it makes them look like they SKIP LEG DAY!
- **PARTICLE EXPLOSIONS** – Jump effects so intense they might trigger your smoke alarm! (Not legally responsible if they actually do)
- **SCREEN SHAKE** – Camera effects that will make your neighbors think there's an earthquake of BUFFNESS!
- **COLOR TRANSITIONS** – Visual feedback so smooth it's like watching a rainbow bench press the sun!

## 🚀💻 TECHNICAL STACK OF POWER
- **Phaser 3.88.0** – HTML5 game framework so buffed it makes other frameworks look like they're still in TUTORIAL MODE!
- **Rapier 0.14.0** – 2D physics engine with muscles so defined it calculates collision responses WHILE DOING ONE-HANDED PUSHUPS!
- **Vite 5.3.1** – Build tool so fast it BREAKS THE SOUND BARRIER and never, EVER skips leg day!
- **JavaScript ES6+** – Programming language so buff it flexes its functions and makes other languages CRY PROTEIN TEARS!

## 🎮🔥 CONTROLS OF ULTIMATE BUFFNESS
- **WASD or Arrow Keys** - Move with such MAXIMUM BUFFNESS your keyboard might need a gym membership!
- **Space Bar** - TRIPLE JUMP with increasing power so intense it might launch your character INTO ORBIT!
- **ESC** - Pause the buffness (but WHY WOULD YOU? Are you AFRAID OF THE GAINS?!)

## 🛠️💪 INSTALLATION & DEVELOPMENT OF EXTREME BUFFNESS

To get this game up and running, first **make sure your machine is BUFF ENOUGH** to handle it. Weak computers may SPONTANEOUSLY START DOING PUSHUPS just to keep up!

```sh
# Install dependencies (INJECT PURE PROTEIN POWDER into your project)
npm install

# Start development server (BEGIN YOUR EXTREME WORKOUT ROUTINE)
npm run dev

# Build for production (ACHIEVE FINAL ULTRA-BUFF FORM)
npm run build
```

Then sit back and **BEHOLD THE MASSIVE GAINS** as your screen FLEXES with pure, unadulterated BUFFNESS! Your GPU might start GRUNTING from the effort!

## 📚💪 DOCUMENTATION OF EXTREME BUFFNESS

Check out the `AIProjectDocs` folder for documentation SO COMPREHENSIVE it might cause INFORMATION OVERLOAD:

- **ArchitecturalOverview.md** - System architecture so high-level it needs OXYGEN TANKS!
- **ImplementationProgress.md** - Status tracker so detailed it makes PROJECT MANAGERS WEEP WITH JOY!
- **GameDesignPrinciples.md** - Design philosophy so deep ARISTOTLE would ask for study notes!
- **EventSystem.md** - Communication system so decoupled it's practically TELEPATHIC!
- **UIManager.md** - UI system so organized it makes MARIE KONDO look MESSY!
- **ModularArchitecture.md** - Module structure so clean it SPARKLES with BUFFNESS!
- **ModularPlayerController.md** - Player architecture so modular it's like LEGO BLOCKS MADE OF PURE MUSCLE!
- **TripleJumpRefinementPlan.md** - Jump planning so strategic SUN TZU would be IMPRESSED!
- **TripleJumpRefinementImplementation.md** - Implementation so detailed it includes THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF BUFFNESS!
- **RapierPhysics.md** - Physics integration so realistic EINSTEIN would say "THAT'S RELATIVELY AWESOME!"
- **PhaserFramework.md** - Phaser details so thorough they make GAME ENGINE CREATORS BLUSH!

## 🧪💥 ARCHITECTURE OF EXTREME BUFFNESS

WynIsBuff2 uses a modular, event-driven architecture SO BUFF it makes software engineers WEEP TEARS OF JOY:

- **EVENT SYSTEM** - Communication so decoupled it's like modules are TELEPATHICALLY SHARING THEIR GAINS!
- **UI MANAGER** - Creates UI elements so BUFF they might FLEX right off your screen!
- **PHYSICS MANAGER** - Rapier physics integration so realistic NEWTON HIMSELF would HIGH-FIVE YOU!
- **LEVEL MANAGER** - Creates levels so CHALLENGING they might make your FINGERS DEVELOP ABS!
- **MODULAR PLAYER CONTROLLER** - A system so specialized it's like having a PERSONAL TRAINER FOR EACH MUSCLE GROUP:
  - **Player Controller** - Coordinates player functionality with the precision of a CHAMPIONSHIP BODYBUILDER!
  - **Jump Controller** - Jump mechanics so refined they make ASTRONAUTS JEALOUS of your air time!
  - **Movement Controller** - Horizontal movement so smooth it's like SKATING ON BUTTER MADE OF PROTEIN!
  - **Collision Controller** - Collision detection so precise it could detect a FLEA DOING PUSHUPS on a PIXEL!

2. ✅ **UI MANAGER IMPLEMENTATION** - UI elements so responsive they ANTICIPATE YOUR NEEDS before you have them!
3. ✅ **TRIPLE JUMP REFINEMENT** - Jump mechanics so enhanced they might BREAK THE LAWS OF PHYSICS:
   - Modular player controller architecture that makes SOFTWARE ENGINEERS CRY TEARS OF JOY!
   - Particle effects so intense they might TRIGGER NEARBY SMOKE DETECTORS!
   - Screen shake so powerful your NEIGHBORS MIGHT CALL ABOUT AN EARTHQUAKE!
   - Color transitions so smooth they make PROFESSIONAL ANIMATORS QUESTION THEIR CAREER CHOICES!
   - Jump physics so refined NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON might call to ask questions!

### IN PROGRESS WITH MAXIMUM EFFORT
4. 🔄 **LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION** - Creating levels so focused they might GIVE YOUR MONITOR LASER VISION!

### UPCOMING BUFFNESS EXPANSIONS
5. **AUDIO AND VISUAL POLISH** - Sound effects so crisp they might SHATTER WINE GLASSES and visuals so enhanced they require SUNGLASSES TO VIEW!
6. **TESTING AND OPTIMIZATION** - Performance so smooth it makes BUTTER JEALOUS and gameplay so optimized it BREAKS SPEEDRUN RECORDS AUTOMATICALLY!

See `AIProjectDocs/ImplementationProgress.md` for the detailed status and plan, if you can handle the RAW, UNFILTERED DOCUMENTATION BUFFNESS!

## 🏆💪 EXTREME LEGAL DISCLAIMER OF BUFFNESS:
By playing **WynIsBuff2**, you accept that:
- Your arms WILL involuntarily flex so hard they might RIP YOUR SLEEVES!
- Your screen MAY NOT be able to contain the full power of Wyn's EXTREME BUFFNESS and might start SWEATING PROTEIN SHAKE!
- Your perception of buffness WILL be forever altered, making all other games look like they COMPLETELY SKIP LEG DAY!
- Your neighbors MAY wonder why you're shouting "JUST ONE MORE REP!" at your computer at 3 AM!
- Your keyboard MAY develop VISIBLE ABS from the intense workout it's getting!

NO REFUNDS. NO MERCY. ONLY EXTREME, UNADULTERATED, PURE BUFFNESS! 💪🔥💥

## AI-Assisted Development with Codex CLI

This project integrates the Codex CLI for AI-assisted coding. Follow these steps to start a session:

1. Install Codex CLI (if needed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @openai/codex-cli
   ```
2. From the project root, load the Codex environment and role:
   ```bash
   source .codex/run-codex.sh phaser-coder
   ```
3. Launch an interactive session:
   ```bash
   codex --project-doc codex-setup.md
   ```
   Codex will load the baseline, active goals, open READY tasks, and display a session plan.

### Common Commands
- codex --help — Show usage information.
- codex -q "<prompt>" — Non-interactive mode.
- codex --approval-mode auto-edit — Automatically approve file edits.

### Defining New Tasks
Add a task under .codex/tasks/ with Status: READY:
```markdown
Status: READY
Owner: phaser-coder
Scope: feature
Estimate: 3

# Brief task title

Describe the task here.
```
Codex will pick up READY tasks in the next session.

For more details, see codex-setup.md.
