# WynIsBuff2 💪🎮

## 🔥 The Buffest, The Gamest, The Most Buff Game There Is! 🔥

Welcome to **WynIsBuff2**, where **Wyn is the Buffest** and the game is so game that it games harder than any game that has ever gamed before.  

Do you have what it takes to **witness pure, unfiltered buffness**? Can you handle the sheer **raw gaming power** of **WynIsBuff2**? This game will push your **gaming biceps** to the **absolute limit**.

## 🏋️ Features of Buffness
- **Triple Jump Mechanics** – Leap with increasing power for maximum buffness.
- **Physics-Powered Movement** – Rapier physics engine for realistic buff interactions.
- **Modular Architecture** – Code so buff it flexes on other codebases.
- **Platforming Challenges** – Test your buff skills across challenging levels.

## 🚀 Technical Stack
- **Phaser 3.88.0** – HTML5 game framework, buffed to the max.
- **Rapier 0.14.0** – 2D physics engine for realistic buff physics.
- **Vite 5.3.1** – Lightning-fast build tool that doesn't skip leg day.
- **JavaScript ES6+** – The buffest of programming languages.

## 🎮 Controls
- **WASD or Arrow Keys** - Move with maximum buffness.  
- **Space Bar** - Triple jump with increasing power.  
- **ESC** - Pause the buffness (if you need a break).  

## 🛠️ Installation & Development

To get this game up and running, first **make sure your machine is buff enough** to handle it.

```sh
# Install dependencies (protein powder for your project)
npm install

# Start development server (begin your workout)
npm run dev

# Build for production (achieve final buff form)
npm run build
```

Then sit back and **behold the gains.**

## 🧪 Architecture

WynIsBuff2 uses a modular, event-driven architecture:

- **Event System** - Decoupled communication between modules
- **UI Manager** - UI element creation and management
- **Physics Manager** - Rapier physics integration
- **Level Manager** - Level creation and management
- **Modular Player Controller** - Specialized controllers for player mechanics:
  - **Player Controller** - Main coordinator for player functionality
  - **Jump Controller** - Jump mechanics and state management
  - **Movement Controller** - Horizontal movement and air control
  - **Collision Controller** - Collision detection and ground state
- **Effect Managers** - Visual feedback systems:
  - **Particle Manager** - Particle effects for jumps, landings, and movement
  - **Camera Manager** - Screen shake and camera effects
  - **Color Manager** - Color transitions for the player sprite

## 🚀 Development Roadmap
