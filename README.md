# WynIsBuff2 💪🎮💥

## 🔥🔥 THE BUFFEST, THE GAMEST, THE MOST ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS BUFF GAME EVER CREATED! 🔥🔥

Welcome to **WynIsBuff2**, where **Wyn isn't just Buff, Wyn is MEGA-ULTRA-HYPER-BUFF** and the game is so game that it games harder than any game that has ever gamed in the history of gaming since games were invented!

Do you have what it takes to **witness pure, unfiltered, RAW BUFFNESS**? Can you handle the sheer **EXPLOSIVE GAMING POWER** of **WynIsBuff2**? This game will make your **gaming biceps EXPLODE** and your **brain muscles FLEX** to the **ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM BUFFNESS LIMIT**!

## 🏋️‍♂️💪 FEATURES OF EXTREME BUFFNESS
- **TRIPLE JUMP MECHANICS** – Leap with increasing power that gets SO BUFF your screen might crack from the sheer force!
- **PHYSICS-POWERED MOVEMENT** – Rapier physics engine so realistic your computer might start sweating protein shake!
- **MODULAR ARCHITECTURE** – Code so buff it not only flexes on other codebases, it makes them look like they SKIP LEG DAY!
- **PARTICLE EXPLOSIONS** – Jump effects so intense they might trigger your smoke alarm! (Not legally responsible if they actually do)
- **SCREEN SHAKE** – Camera effects that will make your neighbors think there's an earthquake of BUFFNESS!
- **COLOR TRANSITIONS** – Visual feedback so smooth it's like watching a rainbow bench press the sun!
- **SCENE TRANSITIONS** – Old-school level progression that hits harder than a protein shake after leg day!
- **PULSATING BOSS** – A menacing obstacle that pulsates with the rhythm of a thousand gym beats!
- **PLAYER GLOW EFFECTS** – Your character radiates pure BUFF ENERGY with a pulsing green aura of GAINS!
- **ATMOSPHERIC PARTICLES** – Background effects that float like protein powder in the wind of VICTORY!

## 🚀💻 TECHNICAL STACK OF POWER
- **Phaser 3.88.0** – HTML5 game framework so buffed it makes other frameworks look like they're still in TUTORIAL MODE!
- **Rapier 0.14.0** – 2D physics engine with muscles so defined it calculates collision responses WHILE DOING ONE-HANDED PUSHUPS!
- **Vite 5.3.1** – Build tool so fast it BREAKS THE SOUND BARRIER and never, EVER skips leg day!
- **JavaScript ES6+** – Programming language so buff it flexes its functions and makes other languages CRY PROTEIN TEARS!
 - **Howler.js** – Audio management for BGM & SFX with MP3/OGG support and stereo panning.

## 🎮🔥 CONTROLS OF ULTIMATE BUFFNESS
- **WASD or Arrow Keys** - Move with such MAXIMUM BUFFNESS your keyboard might need a gym membership!
- **Space Bar** - TRIPLE JUMP with increasing power so intense it might launch your character INTO ORBIT!
- **C** - DUCK under obstacles with the grace of a BUFF NINJA doing limbo at the gym!
- **ESC** - Pause the buffness (but WHY WOULD YOU? Are you AFRAID OF THE GAINS?!)

## 🛠️💪 INSTALLATION & DEVELOPMENT OF EXTREME BUFFNESS

To get this game up and running, first **make sure your machine is BUFF ENOUGH** to handle it. Weak computers may SPONTANEOUSLY START DOING PUSHUPS just to keep up!

```sh
# Install dependencies (INJECT PURE PROTEIN POWDER into your project)
npm install

# Start development server (BEGIN YOUR EXTREME WORKOUT ROUTINE)
npm run dev

# Build for production (ACHIEVE FINAL ULTRA-BUFF FORM)
npm run build

# Run tests (QUALITY ASSURANCE MUSCLE TRAINING)
npm test

# Generate asset constants (AUTOMATIC GAINS GENERATOR)
npm run generate-assets
```

Then sit back and **BEHOLD THE MASSIVE GAINS** as your screen FLEXES with pure, unadulterated BUFFNESS! Your GPU might start GRUNTING from the effort!

## 🏗️💪 ARCHITECTURE SO BUFF IT HAS ITS OWN GYM MEMBERSHIP

This codebase has been through an **EXTREME MAKEOVER** with a feature-based architecture that's **SO ORGANIZED** it makes Marie Kondo look messy!

### 🎯 FEATURE-BASED ORGANIZATION
- **`@features/player`** - Player controls SO RESPONSIVE they respond before you think!
- **`@features/level`** - Level management that NEVER SKIPS LEG DAY!
- **`@features/effects`** - Visual effects so INTENSE they might need safety goggles!
- **`@features/core`** - Core systems SO SOLID they could support a weightlifting competition!

### 🚫 NO MAGIC STRINGS ZONE
We've **ELIMINATED ALL MAGIC STRINGS** like they were empty calories! Every asset, scene, and event uses **GENERATED CONSTANTS** that are SO RELIABLE they show up to the gym even on rest days!

```javascript
// OLD WAY (WEAK AND FEEBLE)
this.scene.start('MainMenu');
this.load.image('player', 'sprites/player.png');

// NEW WAY (MAXIMUM BUFFNESS ACHIEVED)
this.scene.start(SceneKeys.MAIN_MENU);
this.load.image(ImageAssets.PLAYER, ImagePaths.PLAYER);
```

### 📚 DOCUMENTATION GAINS
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - Development guide SO COMPREHENSIVE it could train a new developer from couch to codebase!
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Technical deep-dive SO DETAILED it makes blueprints jealous!
