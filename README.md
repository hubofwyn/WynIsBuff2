# WynIsBuff2 💪🎮💥

## 🔥🔥 THE BUFFEST, THE GAMEST, THE MOST ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS BUFF GAME EVER CREATED! 🔥🔥

Welcome to **WynIsBuff2**, where **Wyn isn't just Buff, Wyn is MEGA-ULTRA-HYPER-BUFF** and the game is so game that it games harder than any game that has ever gamed in the history of gaming since games were invented!

Do you have what it takes to **witness pure, unfiltered, RAW BUFFNESS**? Can you handle the sheer **EXPLOSIVE GAMING POWER** of **WynIsBuff2**? This game will make your **gaming biceps EXPLODE** and your **brain muscles FLEX** to the **ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM BUFFNESS LIMIT**!

## 🏋️‍♂️💪 FEATURES OF EXTREME BUFFNESS
- **TRIPLE JUMP MECHANICS** – Leap with increasing power that gets SO BUFF your screen might crack from the sheer force!
- **PHYSICS-POWERED MOVEMENT** – Rapier physics engine so realistic your computer might start sweating protein shake!
- **MODULAR ARCHITECTURE** – Code so buff it not only flexes on other codebases, it makes them look like they SKIP LEG DAY!
- **PARTICLE EXPLOSIONS** – Jump effects so intense they might trigger your smoke alarm! (Not legally responsible if they actually do)
- **SCREEN SHAKE** – Camera effects that will make your neighbors think there's an earthquake of BUFFNESS!
- **COLOR TRANSITIONS** – Visual feedback so smooth it's like watching a rainbow bench press the sun!

## 🚀💻 TECHNICAL STACK OF POWER
- **Phaser 3.88.0** – HTML5 game framework so buffed it makes other frameworks look like they're still in TUTORIAL MODE!
- **Rapier 0.14.0** – 2D physics engine with muscles so defined it calculates collision responses WHILE DOING ONE-HANDED PUSHUPS!
- **Vite 5.3.1** – Build tool so fast it BREAKS THE SOUND BARRIER and never, EVER skips leg day!
- **JavaScript ES6+** – Programming language so buff it flexes its functions and makes other languages CRY PROTEIN TEARS!

## 🎮🔥 CONTROLS OF ULTIMATE BUFFNESS
- **WASD or Arrow Keys** - Move with such MAXIMUM BUFFNESS your keyboard might need a gym membership!
- **Space Bar** - TRIPLE JUMP with increasing power so intense it might launch your character INTO ORBIT!
- **ESC** - Pause the buffness (but WHY WOULD YOU? Are you AFRAID OF THE GAINS?!)

## 🛠️💪 INSTALLATION & DEVELOPMENT OF EXTREME BUFFNESS

To get this game up and running, first **make sure your machine is BUFF ENOUGH** to handle it. Weak computers may SPONTANEOUSLY START DOING PUSHUPS just to keep up!

```sh
# Install dependencies (INJECT PURE PROTEIN POWDER into your project)
npm install

# Start development server (BEGIN YOUR EXTREME WORKOUT ROUTINE)
npm run dev

# Build for production (ACHIEVE FINAL ULTRA-BUFF FORM)
npm run build
```

Then sit back and **BEHOLD THE MASSIVE GAINS** as your screen FLEXES with pure, unadulterated BUFFNESS! Your GPU might start GRUNTING from the effort!

## 📚💪 DOCUMENTATION OF EXTREME BUFFNESS

Check out the `AIProjectDocs` folder for documentation SO COMPREHENSIVE it might cause INFORMATION OVERLOAD:

- **ArchitecturalOverview.md** - System architecture so high-level it needs OXYGEN TANKS!
- **ImplementationProgress.md** - Status tracker so detailed it makes PROJECT MANAGERS WEEP WITH JOY!
- **GameDesignPrinciples.md** - Design philosophy so deep ARISTOTLE would ask for study notes!
- **EventSystem.md** - Communication system so decoupled it's practically TELEPATHIC!
- **UIManager.md** - UI system so organized it makes MARIE KONDO look MESSY!
- **ModularArchitecture.md** - Module structure so clean it SPARKLES with BUFFNESS!
- **ModularPlayerController.md** - Player architecture so modular it's like LEGO BLOCKS MADE OF PURE MUSCLE!
- **TripleJumpRefinementPlan.md** - Jump planning so strategic SUN TZU would be IMPRESSED!
- **TripleJumpRefinementImplementation.md** - Implementation so detailed it includes THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF BUFFNESS!
- **RapierPhysics.md** - Physics integration so realistic EINSTEIN would say "THAT'S RELATIVELY AWESOME!"
- **PhaserFramework.md** - Phaser details so thorough they make GAME ENGINE CREATORS BLUSH!

## 🧪💥 ARCHITECTURE OF EXTREME BUFFNESS

### IN PROGRESS WITH MAXIMUM EFFORT
4. 🔄 **LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION** - Creating levels so focused they might GIVE YOUR MONITOR LASER VISION!

### UPCOMING BUFFNESS EXPANSIONS
5. **AUDIO AND VISUAL POLISH** - Sound effects so crisp they might SHATTER WINE GLASSES and visuals so enhanced they require SUNGLASSES TO VIEW!
6. **TESTING AND OPTIMIZATION** - Performance so smooth it makes BUTTER JEALOUS and gameplay so optimized it BREAKS SPEEDRUN RECORDS AUTOMATICALLY!

See `AIProjectDocs/ImplementationProgress.md` for the detailed status and plan, if you can handle the RAW, UNFILTERED DOCUMENTATION BUFFNESS!
