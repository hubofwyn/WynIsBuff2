## Baseline (Start of Session 3)

**From Session 2 completion scan**:

- Total files: 117 MD files
- Duplicate titles: 6 instances
- File size: 570.5 KB
- Average size: 4.9 KB per file

**Duplicate Content Identified**:

1. Install instructions: CONTRIBUTING.md vs AIProjectDocs/README.md
2. Testing section: duplicated in AGENTS.md
3. Command examples: duplicated in DOC_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md and NEXT_SESSION_PLAN.md

## Task 1: Consolidate Duplicate Content ✅

**Status**: Complete

**Actions Taken**:

1. **Install Instructions Consolidation**
    - Identified duplication: CONTRIBUTING.md (detailed) vs AIProjectDocs/README.md (simple)
    - Consolidated approach: Made CONTRIBUTING.md the single source of truth
    - Updated AIProjectDocs/README.md to reference CONTRIBUTING.md with clear link
    - Kept quick-start one-liner for convenience
    - Added bullet list showing what's in full guide

2. **Testing Section Analysis**
    - Scanner reported duplicate "Testing" headers in AGENTS.md
    - Investigation: Both instances were comments in code blocks (lines 49, 135)
    - Finding: FALSE POSITIVE - not actual duplicate headers
    - No action needed

**Validation**:

- ✅ No information lost (all content in CONTRIBUTING.md)
- ✅ Clear cross-reference added
- ✅ Git commit clean and documented
- ✅ Single source of truth established

**Impact**:

- Reduced duplicate content
- Clearer documentation hierarchy
- Better maintainability

## Task 2: Restructure AIProjectDocs

**Status**: Pending

**Planned Actions**:

- Categorize each AIProjectDocs file by topic
- Create target directory structure (docs/architecture/, docs/development/, etc.)
- Move files with git mv (preserve history)
- Update all cross-references
- Create redirect notes in old locations
