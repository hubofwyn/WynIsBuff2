## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of Phase 2.1: Triple Jump Refinement, which focused on enhancing visual feedback and refining jump mechanics to create a more satisfying player experience. The implementation includes architectural changes, visual feedback enhancements, and physics refinements.

## Architectural Changes

### Modular Player Controller

The most significant architectural change is the modularization of the PlayerController into specialized components:

1. **PlayerController**: Acts as a coordinator that delegates to specialized controllers
2. **JumpController**: Handles all jump-related functionality
3. **MovementController**: Handles horizontal movement and air control
4. **CollisionController**: Handles collision detection and ground state

This modular approach provides several benefits:

- Better separation of concerns
- More maintainable and testable code
- Easier to extend and modify
- More granular control over player mechanics

### Effect Systems

Three new effect systems have been implemented to enhance visual feedback:

1. **ParticleManager**: Handles particle effects for jumps, landings, and movement
2. **CameraManager**: Handles screen shake and camera effects
3. **ColorManager**: Handles color transitions for the player sprite

These effect systems are integrated with the Event System to provide decoupled visual feedback based on player actions.

## Visual Feedback Enhancements

### 1. Improved Color Changes

The original implementation used instant color changes based on jump state:

- Ground state: Blue (0x0000FF)
- First jump: Green (0x00FF00)
- Second jump: Yellow (0xFFFF00)
- Third jump: Red (0xFF0000)

The enhanced implementation uses the ColorManager to provide:

- Smooth color transitions between states
- Brightness changes based on jump phase (rising, peak, falling)
- Pulse effects for jumps and landings
- Color interpolation for smooth transitions

### 2. Particle Effects

The ParticleManager provides rich particle effects for various player actions:

#### Jump Particles

- **First Jump**: Simple dust cloud below player
- **Second Jump**: Energy particles in a wider pattern
- **Third Jump**: Burst effect in all directions

#### Landing Particles

- Dust cloud proportional to landing velocity
- Impact ripple effect for high-velocity landings

#### Movement Particles

- Subtle dust trail when moving quickly on the ground

### 3. Screen Shake

The CameraManager provides contextual screen shake effects:

- **Jump Shake**:
    - No shake for first jump
    - Subtle shake for second jump
    - Stronger shake for third jump

- **Landing Shake**:
    - Intensity based on landing velocity
    - Direction influenced by movement direction

### 4. Squash and Stretch Effects

Added squash and stretch effects for jumps and landings:

- Stretch effect when jumping
- Squash effect when landing
- Intensity based on jump type and landing velocity

## Physics Refinements

### 1. Jump Buffering

Implemented a jump buffer system that allows players to press the jump button slightly before landing, and the jump will execute as soon as the player touches the ground. This makes the controls feel more responsive and forgiving.

```javascript
// Jump buffering implementation
bufferJump() {
    // Clear any existing buffer timer
    if (this._jumpBufferTimer) {
        this._jumpBufferTimer.remove();
    }

    // Create a new buffer timer
    this._jumpBufferTimer = this.scene.time.delayedCall(
        this.jumpParams.bufferTime,
        () => {
            this._jumpBufferTimer = null;
        }
    );
}
```

### 2. Variable Jump Height

Implemented variable jump height based on button press duration. If the player releases the jump button early, the upward velocity is reduced, resulting in a shorter jump.

```javascript
// Variable jump height implementation
trackJumpKeyState(input) {
    // Check if any jump key is held
    const jumpKeyDown =
        input.spaceKey.isDown ||
        input.wasd.up.isDown ||
        input.cursors.up.isDown;

    // Track when jump key is released during a jump
    if (this._jumpKeyHeld && !jumpKeyDown && this.jumpState === 'rising') {
        this._jumpReleased = true;

        // Apply variable jump height by cutting the upward velocity
        if (this.body && this._jumpReleased) {
            const currentVel = this.body.linvel();
            if (currentVel.y < 0) {
                // Only reduce velocity if still moving upward
                this.body.setLinvel({
                    x: currentVel.x,
                    y: currentVel.y * this.jumpParams.releaseMultiplier
                }, true);
            }
        }
    }

    // Update jump key held state
    this._jumpKeyHeld = jumpKeyDown;
}
```

### 3. Refined Air Control

Implemented different movement parameters for ground and air to provide more realistic air control:

```javascript
// Ground movement parameters
groundParams = {
    moveSpeed: 35, // Moderate max speed
    snapFactor: 0.8, // How quickly to snap to target velocity (0-1)
    stopSnapFactor: 0.9, // How quickly to stop (0-1)
    directionChangeFactor: 1.5, // Multiplier for direction changes
};

// Air movement parameters
airParams = {
    moveSpeed: 30, // Slightly lower max speed in air
    snapFactor: 0.6, // Slower acceleration in air
    stopSnapFactor: 0.05, // Much slower stopping in air
    directionChangeFactor: 1.2, // Less responsive direction changes in air
};
```

### 4. Improved Falling Acceleration

Implemented a more natural falling acceleration curve that starts slower and accelerates as the player falls:

```javascript
// Improved falling acceleration
calculateFallingVelocity(currentVelY) {
    // Only apply falling acceleration if moving downward and not on ground
    if (currentVelY > 0 && !this.isOnGround) {
        let newVelY = currentVelY;

        if (this.fallingParams.accelerationCurve) {
            // Accelerate falling speed with a curve for better feel
            // Slower acceleration at first, then faster as player falls
            const fallProgress = Math.min(currentVelY / 20, 1); // 0-1 based on fall speed
            const accelerationFactor = this.fallingParams.baseAcceleration +
                (this.fallingParams.maxAcceleration - this.fallingParams.baseAcceleration) * fallProgress;

            newVelY = currentVelY * accelerationFactor;
        } else {
            // Simple constant acceleration
            newVelY = currentVelY * this.fallingParams.baseAcceleration;
        }

        // Cap maximum fall speed
        if (newVelY > this.fallingParams.maxFallSpeed) {
            newVelY = this.fallingParams.maxFallSpeed;
        }

        return newVelY;
    }

    // If not falling or on ground, return current velocity unchanged
    return currentVelY;
}
```

### 5. Landing Recovery

Implemented a brief landing recovery state that slightly reduces movement speed after landing:

```javascript
// Landing recovery implementation
handleLanding(body, sprite) {
    // Start landing recovery timer
    this._isInLandingRecovery = true;
    this._landingRecoveryTimer = this.scene.time.delayedCall(
        this.jumpParams.landingRecoveryTime,
        () => {
            this._isInLandingRecovery = false;
            this._landingRecoveryTimer = null;
        }
    );

    // Apply a small squash effect on landing
    this.applySquashEffect(sprite, 1.2, 0.8, 100);

    // Emit landing events...
}
```

### 6. Jump State Tracking

Implemented comprehensive jump state tracking to detect different phases of a jump:

```javascript
// Jump state tracking
updateJumpState(body, sprite) {
    const currentVel = body.linvel();

    // Only track jump state if we're in the air and have used jumps
    if (!this.isOnGround && this._currentJumpNumber > 0) {
        // Detect rising to peak transition
        if (this.jumpState === 'rising' && currentVel.y >= -2 && currentVel.y <= 2) {
            this.jumpState = 'peak';
            // Emit jump peak event...
        }
        // Detect peak to falling transition
        else if (this.jumpState === 'peak' && currentVel.y > 2) {
            this.jumpState = 'falling';
            // Emit jump fall event...
        }
        // Detect rising state if velocity is significantly upward
        else if (this.jumpState === 'grounded' && currentVel.y < -5) {
            this.jumpState = 'rising';
            // Emit jump start event...
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing

A dedicated test page has been created to verify the particle effects:

- `tests/particle-test.html`: A standalone test page that demonstrates the particle effects for jumps, landings, and movement.

This test page allows for isolated testing of the particle effects without needing to run the full game.

## Future Considerations

### 1. Performance Optimization

The current implementation adds several new visual effects that may impact performance on lower-end devices. Future optimizations could include:

- Particle pooling to reduce garbage collection
- Configurable effect quality settings
- Selective disabling of effects based on performance metrics

### 2. Accessibility

The current implementation adds screen shake and other visual effects that may cause issues for players with motion sensitivity or other accessibility needs. Future improvements could include:

- Options to disable or reduce screen shake
- Options to reduce particle effects
- Options to use alternative visual feedback methods

### 3. Audio Integration

The current implementation focuses on visual feedback, but audio feedback is equally important for a satisfying player experience. Future work should include:

- Jump sound effects that vary based on jump type
- Landing sound effects that vary based on impact velocity
- Movement sound effects for running and changing direction

### 4. Further Physics Refinements

While the current implementation significantly improves the jump mechanics, there are still opportunities for further refinement:

- More precise collision detection for edge cases
- Additional forgiveness mechanics for platforming
- Fine-tuning of jump parameters based on player feedback
