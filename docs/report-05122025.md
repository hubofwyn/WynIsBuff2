# WynIsBuff2 Game Architecture Report – 2025-05-12

## 1. High-Level Game Structure

### Frameworks & Tools Used:

- **Phaser 3.88.0** - Main game loop, rendering, and scene management
- **Rapier 0.14.0** - 2D physics powered by WebAssembly
- **Howler.js** - Audio handling (BGM, SFX)
- **Vite** - Build/dev server
- **ES6+ JavaScript**

### Entry Point:

- `src/main.js` sets up a Phaser game with custom scenes (`Boot`, `Game`, `GameOver`, `PauseScene`, etc.)

---

## 2. Core Code Organization

### Main Module Locations:

- **`src/`**
    - **`constants/`** — Event names, level data, physics config, UI config, etc.
    - **`modules/`** — All game systems and controllers, grouped by responsibility
        - **`effects/`** — Camera, color, particle managers
        - **`enemy/`** — Enemy controller(s)
        - **`level/`** — Level system & factories
        - **`player/`** — Cleanly abstracted player subsystems
    - **`scenes/`** — All game scenes (menus, levels, onboarding, etc.)

### Example Hierarchy:

- **Scenes:** Boot, Preloader, Welcome, CharacterSelect, MainMenu, Game, Pause, Settings, GameOver
- **Managers/Controllers:** Audio, Event, GameState, Input, Physics, UI
- **Player:** PlayerController (uses Movement, Jump, Collision subcontrollers)

---

## 3. Architecture Patterns

### Modular OOP:

- Each core aspect is encapsulated in its own _Manager_ or _Controller_ class, instantiated and coordinated via scenes

### Central Event System:

- Pub/sub model—custom `EventSystem` class
- Low coupling between modules

### Explicit Factories+Controllers:

- Level and player logic split into smaller single-responsibility classes

### Separation By Concern:

- Physics, input, UI, particles, color, audio, and state are distinct and interact through events

---

## 4. Code Quality Strengths

- **Well-modularized:** No evidence of "God Objects." Controllers and managers are focused
- **Descriptive naming & structure:** Class/function/module names are highly descriptive
- **Extensible:** Adding new powerups or effects would only require new modules, not editing a monolith
- **Good use of constants:** All event names, level configs, and UI configs are separated from logic
- **Commented/documented:** Most classes/methods have docblocks

---

## 5. Existing Test Infrastructure

- There is evidence of tests (e.g., in `tests/`), especially for core non-Phaser logic like `GameStateManager`
- Manual test scripts are present (`run-tests.js`, etc.), and there is an HTML test for particles

---

## 6. Areas for Improvement & Concerns

### A. Modernization & Maintainability

- **Prefer TypeScript:** No type-checking; strong types would catch many errors and enable better autocompletion
- **ES6+ classes, but no clear linting/formatting config**
    - Add ESLint/Prettier with the team's desired config for consistency
- **Monolithic scene classes:**
    - Some `Game.js` and MainMenu classes are likely quite large
    - Consider extracting scene-specific helpers for complex scenes or using helper objects

### B. Cross-Module Communication

- **EventSystem is locally instantiated per scene**—risk of duplicate events or objects
    - Consider a global registry for single event bus per session, unless scenes must be absolutely isolated
- **GameStateManager appears to read settings from storage in every instance**
    - Should be singleton-like or DI'ed where _persistence_ is actually needed

### C. Dependency Management

- **Direct `localStorage` access**
    - Abstraction layer would make testing easier and could allow for "cloud save" backends in the future
- **Hard-wired asset paths in modules** (audio manager, etc.)
    - Centralize assets config so paths change in one place; helpful for future asset pipeline changes

### D. Testing Automation

- **Tests are present, but not fully automated for all modules**
    - _Suggestion_: Integrate Mocha/Jest for non-Phaser logic, and some automated e2e (using Headless Chrome) for Phaser flows
    - Focus tests on pure logic managers like `GameStateManager`, `EventSystem`, etc.

### E. Scene and Manager Lifecycle

- **Manual initialization:** Scenes take explicit responsibility for wiring up all core managers
    - This is clear but verbose; consider an application-level dependency injection pattern for easier extensibility and testability
- **Potential for circular or duplicate initialization, especially across effects managers and UI**

### F. "God Constants"

- **Level data as a giant JS object:**
    - This is fine for now, but tends toward bloat
    - As the game expands, consider moving to data-driven formats (JSON, Tiled, etc.)
- **No i18n:** All UI text appears hardcoded

### G. Async Asset Management

- **No mention of asset preloading/late-loading strategies**
    - Ensure all scenes properly use Preloader to avoid race conditions in slow connections
    - Some asset keys are assumed to already exist (e.g. MainMenu logo/textures)

## 7. Summary Table

| Aspect        | Current State                         | Suggested Improvement                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Modularity    | High, clear divisions                 | Some managers/scene logic can still be split for SRP |
| Types         | JS/ES6 classes                        | Move to TypeScript for safety                        |
| Testing       | Early manual/unit tests               | Adopt Jest/Mocha with CI                             |
| Event System  | Homegrown event system per scene      | Global bus or DI for singleton                       |
| Assets/Static | Hardcoded paths/configs               | Centralize asset config; plan for i18n               |
| Save/Settings | LocalStorage + explicit keys          | Abstraction layer; plan for cloud-save               |
| Formatting    | Unclear if linter/formatter used      | Add ESLint/Prettier                                  |
| Physics       | Excellent (Rapier, separated manager) | —                                                    |

## 8. Concrete Next Steps

1. **Introduce typechecking (TypeScript or JSDoc + VSCode/TypeScript server)**
2. **Add automated linting/formatting (ESLint + Prettier)**
3. **Refactor for single EventSystem & GameStateManager instance per game**
4. **Automate tests, especially for non-Phaser logic**
5. **Prepare for future content pipeline externalization (levels, assets, text)**
6. **Review and (if needed) refactor large scene files for SRP**
7. **Begin decoupling asset/config paths into clarified asset/config modules**
