# AIProjectDocs Historical Archive

Historical documentation from the original AIProjectDocs directory. These files represent completed work, superseded plans, or resolved issues preserved for historical context.

## Archive Policy

Documents are archived here when they:

1. Represent completed implementation phases (MVP-specific docs)
2. Document resolved issues or bugs
3. Are explicitly marked as deprecated
4. Provide historical context but no current development value

## Contents

| Document                                                             | Archive Reason                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ImplementationProgress.md](./ImplementationProgress.md)             | Dated progress report from earlier development phase           |
| [LevelManagerWrapperIssue.md](./LevelManagerWrapperIssue.md)         | Specific issue that has been resolved                          |
| [MVPRecommendations.md](./MVPRecommendations.md)                     | MVP-phase recommendations, superseded by current architecture  |
| [RevisedMVPImplementationPlan.md](./RevisedMVPImplementationPlan.md) | MVP-phase plan, superseded by current implementation           |
| [MovementSystem.md.deprecated](./MovementSystem.md.deprecated)       | Explicitly deprecated, replaced by current MovementSystem docs |

## Using Archived Docs

### When to Reference

- Understanding historical decisions and their rationale
- Researching why certain approaches were abandoned
- Learning from past implementation challenges

### When NOT to Reference

- Current development work (use docs in active directories)
- Architecture patterns (see [docs/architecture/](../../architecture/))
- Implementation guides (see [docs/systems/](../../systems/) and [docs/features/](../../features/))

## Active Documentation

For current, maintained documentation:

- **Architecture**: [docs/architecture/](../../architecture/)
- **Technology**: [docs/technology/](../../technology/)
- **Systems**: [docs/systems/](../../systems/)
- **Features**: [docs/features/](../../features/)
- **Design**: [docs/design/](../../design/)
- **Index**: [docs/INDEX.md](../../INDEX.md)

## Restoration

If an archived document becomes relevant again:

1. Review content for accuracy with current codebase
2. Update to match current conventions and patterns
3. Move to appropriate active directory
4. Update INDEX.md to reference new location
