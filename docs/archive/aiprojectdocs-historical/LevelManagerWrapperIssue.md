# Level Manager Wrapper Issue

## Issue Description

The game was experiencing an error where `getCurrentLevelConfig` was not being recognized. This occurred because the wrapper `LevelManager` class in `src/modules/LevelManager.js` was missing several methods that were present in the modular implementation (`src/modules/level/LevelManager.js`).

## Root Cause

The wrapper class was created to maintain backward compatibility while delegating to the new modular implementation. However, it was not fully implementing all the methods from the modular version, causing methods like `getCurrentLevelConfig()` to be undefined when called from `Game.js`.

## Solution

Added the missing methods to the wrapper class:

1. `getCurrentLevelConfig()` - Returns the current level configuration
2. `getCurrentLevelId()` - Returns the current level ID
3. `isLevelOperationInProgress()` - Checks if a level operation is in progress

Each of these methods simply delegates to the corresponding method in the modular implementation.

## Implementation Details

```javascript
/**
 * Get the current level ID
 * @returns {string} The current level ID
 */
getCurrentLevelId() {
    return this.levelManager.getCurrentLevelId();
}

/**
 * Get the current level configuration
 * @returns {Object} The current level configuration
 */
getCurrentLevelConfig() {
    return this.levelManager.getCurrentLevelConfig();
}

/**
 * Check if a level is currently being loaded or in transition
 * @returns {boolean} Whether a level operation is in progress
 */
isLevelOperationInProgress() {
    return this.levelManager.isLevelOperationInProgress();
}
```

## Design Considerations

When creating wrapper classes or adapters between different implementations, it's important to ensure that all methods used by client code are properly implemented in the wrapper. This maintains the expected interface and prevents runtime errors.

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider using TypeScript interfaces to ensure implementation completeness
2. Add unit tests that verify all required methods are present in wrapper classes
3. When refactoring to a modular architecture, create a comprehensive list of all public methods that need to be supported in wrapper classes
