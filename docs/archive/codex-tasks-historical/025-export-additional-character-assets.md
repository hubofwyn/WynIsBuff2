# Export Additional Character Assets

Task: Ensure the following character sprite assets are exported and available under `assets/images/characters/`:

- `ila_sprite.png` (Favorite Sister)
- `axel_sprite.png` (Not Buff Axel)
- `wyn_sprite.png` (Wyn the Buff)
- `axelface.png` (Boss placeholder)

Steps:
• Assets already present in `assets/images/characters/`: - ila_sprite.png - axel_sprite.png - wyn_sprite.png - axelface.png
• No further export needed.

## Change Log

- Confirmed additional character sprite PNGs are present under `assets/images/characters/`.
