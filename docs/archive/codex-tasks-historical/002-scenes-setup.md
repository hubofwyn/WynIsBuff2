# Scenes Structure Setup

Task: Scaffold Phaser scenes under src/scenes. Create the following scene classes with proper lifecycle methods (constructor, preload, create, update) and placeholder content or logging:

- BootScene
- PreloaderScene
- MainMenuScene
- GameScene
- GameOverScene

## Change Log

- Added update() method stubs to all Phaser scene classes (Boot, Preloader, MainMenu, GameOver).
