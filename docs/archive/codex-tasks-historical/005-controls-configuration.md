# Input & Controls Configuration

Task: Establish input mapping module under src/modules/InputManager. Implement:
  - Mapping for WASD and Arrow keys, SPACE, and ESC.
  - Emitting control events (e.g., MOVE_LEFT, JUMP, PAUSE) via the EventSystem.
  - Initialization hook to register key listeners on scene startup.

## Change Log
- Created InputManager to map Arrow/WASD/SPACE/ESC/R to EventSystem events.
- Defined and emitted EventNames: MOVE_LEFT, MOVE_RIGHT, MOVE_UP, MOVE_DOWN, JUMP, PAUSE, LEVEL_RESET.
- Integrated InputManager in Game scene: replaced direct keyboard handlers with event subscriptions.
