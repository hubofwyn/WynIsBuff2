# Level & Layout Setup

Task: Scaffold LevelManager under src/modules. Implement methods to:
  - Load level configuration data (e.g., JSON or JS objects).
  - Instantiate platforms, hazards, and triggers based on config.
  - Provide placeholder tilemap or static object creation logic.
  - Expose API for querying level bounds and spawn points.

## Change Log
- Modular LevelManager (wrapper) present in src/modules/LevelManager.js
- Modular implementation under src/modules/level includes LevelLoader, factories, controllers
- APIs: loadLevel(), getPlatforms(), getGround(), getCurrentLevelConfig(), update(), etc.
