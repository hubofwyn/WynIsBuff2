# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer actively used but preserved for reference.

## Archive Structure

### codex-tasks-historical/
**Archived**: October 28, 2025
**Reason**: Historical task tracking - all tasks completed
**Original Location**: `.codex/tasks/`

Contains completed task files from the Codex project management system. These tasks tracked the initial development and implementation of WynIsBuff2 features.

**Status**: All tasks marked as DONE
**Format**: Markdown with metadata (Status, Owner, Scope, Estimate)
**Content**: Task descriptions and change logs

**Why Archived**:
- All tasks completed
- No longer part of active development workflow
- Preserved for historical context and audit trail
- Stub files (<50 tokens) were cluttering documentation health metrics

**Access**: Files remain available here for reference if needed to understand implementation history.
