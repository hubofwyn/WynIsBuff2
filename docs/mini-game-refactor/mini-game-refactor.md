Looking at your mega file and the refactoring plan, let's start with **Phase 1: Isolate the Rules** since it's the quickest win with the highest impact. I'll create the `BdayConfig.js` file extracting all your magic numbers.

## Phase 1: BdayConfig.jsNow let's move to **Phase 2: BdayGameManager** - This is the most important step for integration as it becomes the API for your minigame.Now for **Phase 3: Fix the Player** - This is the critical fix. Your player MUST be a Physics object or collisions will fail.Now let's create **Phase 4: BdayUIManager** - This decouples your UI completely from game logic through event-driven updates.Finally, **Phase 5: BdayObjectManager** - This handles all spawning, scrolling, and object pooling to clean up your update loop.Now let me show you how all these pieces come together in your **refactored Scene file**:## Summary of Your Refactored Architecture

I've implemented all 5 phases from your refactoring plan. Here's what you now have:

### What We Accomplished:
- **From 1900+ lines → ~300 lines** in your main Scene file
- **Separated concerns** - Each class has exactly one responsibility
- **Fixed the critical collision bug** - Player is now a proper Physics Sprite
- **Event-driven architecture** - UI completely decoupled from game logic
- **Professional structure** - Ready for integration with your main game

### File Structure:
```
src/
├── scenes/
│   └── BirthdayMinigame.js (300 lines - just orchestration)
├── game/
│   ├── BdayConfig.js (all configuration in one place)
│   ├── BdayGameManager.js (game state & API)
│   ├── BdayUIManager.js (UI controller)
│   └── BdayObjectManager.js (spawning & pooling)
└── entities/
    └── Player.js (physics-enabled player)
```

### Migration Path:

1. **Start with BdayConfig.js** - Zero behavior change, just extract numbers
2. **Test after each phase** - The game should work at every step
3. **Use the strangler pattern** - Gradually replace old code with new managers
4. **Keep both versions** - Until you're confident the refactor is complete

### Key Integration Points:

Your `BdayGameManager` is now the API for your minigame. Your main game can:
```javascript
// Get minigame state
const score = birthdayScene.gameManager.score;
const deliveries = birthdayScene.gameManager.deliveries;

// Listen to minigame events
birthdayScene.events.on(BdayEvents.BIRTHDAY_COMPLETE, (data) => {
    mainGame.unlockAchievement('birthday_champion');
    mainGame.addCurrency(data.score);
});
```

### Critical Gotchas Addressed:

1. **Player collision fix** ✓ - Now extends `Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Sprite`
2. **Event cleanup** ✓ - All managers have `destroy()` methods
3. **Object pooling** ✓ - Reuses objects instead of constant create/destroy
4. **Delta-based movement** ✓ - Consistent timing using `delta/1000`

### Next Steps:

1. Test the Player class first - It's the most critical change
2. Gradually move sections of your mega file into the managers
3. Run the game after each change to catch issues early
4. Once working, optimize the object pooling limits based on performance

The refactored code is now maintainable, testable, and ready to grow with your game. Each piece can be modified independently without breaking others.
